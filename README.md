# UserScripts

This is bundle of some of my GreaseMonkey scripts.

Branch structure:

- `gm` is the main branch which contains the userscripts for easy reference
- `master` binds all branches together using `git submodule`.
- all other branches keep additional resources for userscripts.

Note that submodules might contain additional submodules, so be sure to use `--recursive`.


## Usage

Just use the `raw` URL to include a UserScript from this Repo into FF.

For more info, see the `master` branch.

## License

- All scripts here are:
  Free as in free beer, free speech and free baby.
- This perhaps does not apply to some of the subresources used by the UserScripts.
